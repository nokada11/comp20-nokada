# COMP 20 Lab 7
Naoki Okada

All aspects of the lab have been implemented correctly.

I refered to this link https://howtodoinjava.com/scripting/jquery/jquery-detect-if-enter-key-is-pressed/ to understand how to process when the enter key is pressed.

I approximately spent 1 hour on this assignment.
