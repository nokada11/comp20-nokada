1. What is this purpose of this Git repository?

- The purpose of this Git respository is to manages sets of files used for assignments
and labs in this class. This repository keeps track of changes I make. That way I can
refer to all the code after each commit.

2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

- My favorite assignment was assignment 3, as it taught me the basics of back-end and how
to connect it to front-end. Another reason I liked this assignment was because it introduced
me to databases, which I will need in the future if I were to work on web development.

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

- I believe I have grown a lot from the start of this course because I am now able to use
tools that I was not familiar with at all before. For instance, I had no clue how to write code
for back-end or how to use databases.

4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two 
examples as evidence.

- Never ever trust user input
	- In assignment 4, we hacked into each other's sites and it was very doable since we did not
	add security measures in assignment 3
	- Cross-site scripting and database injection as demonstrated in class

5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve 
deeper into?

- I would like to delve deeper into security, as there always seems to be things to be improved.
The fact that there are hackers who consistently attempt to hack into sites and those who try to 
protect their sites amuses me since it seems like a never-ending battle. I believe security is of 
higher importance to any institution and that is also why I would like to learn more about it.
